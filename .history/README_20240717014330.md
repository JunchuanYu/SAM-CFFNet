## SAM-CFFNet
![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/100/v2-0c695da78b2119b960785047eaf78bc8_r.jpg 'SAM-CFFNet')
+ SAM-CFFNet backbone from [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), some code references [Attention UNet](https://github.com/EdgarLefevre/Attention_Unet_Pytorch), [HRNet](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/HRNet), [Deeplabv3+](https://github.com/yassouali/pytorch_segmentation/blob/master/models/deeplabv3_plus.py). SAM-CFFNet achieved the highest accuracy across three open-source remote sensing landslide datasets compared to other contrastive models.
